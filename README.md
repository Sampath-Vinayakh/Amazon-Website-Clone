# amazon-website-clone

- Built a front-pageclone of amazon using html and css functionalities.
- Used css flexbox and css positions to build out the header of the page.
- Used nested layouts technique to show the product information for each prpduct and wrapped it inside a css grid to restrict the number of products per row. 
- Worked with javascript to add interactivity for the website which adds items to the cart when the add-to-cart button is clicked.
